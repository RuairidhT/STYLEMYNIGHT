# STYLEMYNIGHT

You are required to individually implement, test and demonstrate your proposed application on the Android platform. For apps that requiresignificant development, you may choose to implement a subset of the features, which you should justify in your video.  However, you should ensure you are producing a useful application that is fit for purpose. Following the Lean UX methodology, you are required to test your app with users atregular intervals and show improvements based on user feedback.   

The minimumrequirement I that you undertake user testing of three distinct stages of app development,with at least 3 users for each stage. The first can be on the paper prototype created forthe app proposal, the other two should be on coded prototypes. Timetabled sessions willbe used to give the opportunity for this with your peers. Your report should explain theresults from the testing and how you addressed them for the next iteration, or how theywould be addressed in future.
